- Reasons
	- Flexibility
	- Cardio
	- Overall good health
- Common methods suck, i.e Tai Chi, Yoga
	- Perfectionist - If you don't do the movements perfectly, don't do them at all
	- Elitist - Need a teacher, also 10 years of experience
	- Tells me how to think - "Become one with your inner self"
- Dancing fulfills similar needs, but:
	- Finding music feels eh
	- No need to be so strict wrt tempo and such
	- Bit sad dancing alone innit
- Stretches?
	- Don't want to overdo these
	- They're not really a workout

## Pose interpolation
Idea: Take a bunch of poses from yoga, dances, tai chi. Then go from one pose to the other.
- Low-effort, good for flexibility and core strength.
- No need to be perfect, just don't hurt self.
- Gets rid of preconceptions - can do whatever I want
